**Self Work**

I work with data, that is my main source of matter, from there I use it to make own work related to the notion of time in daily life, and images that seams to be regular, but their are build by the conscious use of randomness. That own work had leading me to work freelance for companies like Movistar Chile, in the making of data visualization for reports, a startUp were I design the UI and experience for a new MIDI Controller. 

This body of work have bring me one of he most interesting challenges, teaching programming and researching for inclusion in programming.
